See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart04.

Experiments related to the svc/swi instruction, as with interrupts I
discourage the use of interrupts or svc/swi unless you really have a
good reason.  And if you do use svc/swi perhaps this example demonstrates
that you want to avoid using the immediate in the instruction.
