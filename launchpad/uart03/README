See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart02.  This uses the timer0 16/32 bit timer in 32 bit
mode.  The timer can free run, just like the systick timer in the arm
core.  Like the blinker02 example this does not use it purely as a free
running timer, but instead has a load value of 32 million so that it
rolls over every 2 seconds (assuming/using a 16MHz clock).  The raw
interrupt status is polled (interrupts are not enabled/used) to see
the roll over and prints something out the uart.  The leds are so
painful on the (my) eyes that I wont use them.

I so far have not been able to get the prescaler working, will keep trying.
